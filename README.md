# ImageClassification
Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a binary image classification model is formed where I have tested how much similarity is there between the images of two brothers. This project is inspired from the dogs’ and cats’ image classification problem.

**As the real dataset contains personal images, I have uploaded the classic dogs and cats image dataset
